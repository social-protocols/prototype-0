# Notes on process that we outlined on Sep 15, 2023

## Start with *questions*.

	This is valuable when a lot of people are talking about some subject, and there is a common point of ignorance. For example the Kyle Rittenhouse thing.

	Questions are posted somewhere independently (some fact-checking forum like Birdwatch). E.g. "was Kyle Rittenhouse acting in self defense?""

	Anybody can attach a question to any tweet (just paste the question URL) just like anybody can make a comment. 

	If there are not a lot of comments then use bridge-based ranking to determine what questions will shown at the top of the comment thread.
		Questions shouldn't be super-controversial anyway. Because people tend to agree on the relevance of questions (e.g. they agree on what are the controversial questions).

	The answer to the question is not binary, instead it is a top answer (the most helpful answer).

	Once a top answer is identified, it is automatically shown wherever the question is shown. 

	The question with top answer might be displayed as an attachment to tweets where  there is data showing the question is relevant/helpful to that tweet (the reputation of the person who attached the question might be enough to establish relevance.)

	In the place where the question is discussed, people simply post answers as comments, but we don't need to classify the answers as agree-disagree.

	Rate answers as "helpful". We can also ask people how they answer the question, which implicitly tells us whether answers are pro-con. However, we don't necessarily need to show percentage agree/disagree, just the most helpful answer. 
		It could actually be that people that answer the questions "yes" might actually vote that an answer arguing "no" is the most helpful. It was helpful just not enough to change their mind.
		We could perhaps put questions directly under questions. When the question gets answered, then the question itself becomes an answer.


	Example walk through

		So, pregnant people canâ€™t cross state lines to get abortions but guys like Kyle Rittenhouse can cross state lines to murder people. Seems fair.

			Question: Did Kyle Rittenhouse commit murder?

			Top Answer: Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of murder charges. The jury agreed that he acted in self-defense.

		So this becomes the Top Answer because that is the comment that people found was the most helpful. We can also ask people if they think the answer to the question is yes/no, but we don't need to do this to identify top answer.

		What's more, displaying this top answer under all the tweets where the question was posted is super valuable. It becomes an important annotation because a lot of people don't realize Rittenhouse was acquitted.

		But then let's say somebody that thinks the verdict was wrong makes this comment in response to the top answer

			People don't carry assault weapons across state lines in order to commit self defense.




		Then lots of people find this helpful.

				Question: Did the video evidence show that he was actually defending himself?

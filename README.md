# Roadmap




# Ideas
- Bridged-based ranking for questions let's the discussion group draw attention towards which information is missing and needs to be reasoned about. If everyone from different perspectives
- Comment threads can always be unstructured/non-formal, but they can be used to extract good arguments (a piece of information which changed many minds) or good questions (missing information)


# Insights
- Bayesian reasoning can work without changing people's minds. By asking them for conditionals, e.g. "Assuming X is true, do you believe Y?"
- If we want bayesian reasoning without asking for conditionals, people have to change their mind to make progress.
- if misinformation becomes popular, it's because many people actually believe it. Suppressing it does not make people learn. Instead it should become popular together with corrected information (like community notes), so everyones learns from that.
